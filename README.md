# Attendance Recorder

**Attendance Recorder** is my first full-stack application, designed to mimic the functionality of a classic attendance recorder. It provides a user-friendly way to manage and track attendance, combining the capabilities of modern APIs, database management, and a hosted client-server architecture.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with full-stack development. Through this project, I aimed to:
- Learn how to create and call APIs.
- Understand how to store and retrieve data from a database.
- Host a software application, enabling users to interact with it.

## Application

This software is versatile and can be used in various educational settings, from elementary schools to college-level institutions. It simplifies the process of recording and managing attendance for educators and administrators.

## Reflection

As my first full-stack project, this experience taught me valuable lessons, including:
- Understanding object mapping in the context of databases.
- Safely and efficiently storing and retrieving data.
- Managing data type conversions when exchanging information between APIs and objects.
- Appreciating the complexity and thoughtfulness required to build a complete, functional application.
